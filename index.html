        <p>I am Al Yang. I'm currently attending Cerritos College taking  courses that will lead to a degree in computer engineering. I've had various types of jobs over the years some of which include commerical real estate appraiser, loan officer, inside sales at a computer wholesaler and marketing/public relations for a record label. Pursuing studies in the sciences and engineering is the latest and most exciting phase of my journey.</p>
