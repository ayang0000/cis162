    <h1>Al Yang</h1>
        <p>I am Al Yang. I'm currently attending Cerritos College taking  courses that will lead to a degree in computer engineering. I've had various types of jobs over the years some of which include commerical real estate appraiser, loan officer, inside sales at a computer wholesaler and marketing/public relations for a record label. Pursuing studies in the sciences and engineering is the latest and most exciting phase of my journey.</p>

<h1>When I have free time</h1>
<ul>
    <li>I spend time with my parents by taking them to places</li>
    <li>I look up new topics to study and learn in the math and sciences</li>
    <li>I like to travel</li>
</ul>

<p>My favorite website that I visit a lot to search for science topics is <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>
